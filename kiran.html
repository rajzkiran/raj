            Cauliflower fried rice | gobi rice recipe | gobi manchurian rice is a popular street food in India. This is
            a flavorful and delicious rice using cauliflower. This easy Indo-Chinese recipe is an aromatic rice with
            spiced / marinated and deep fried or air fried cauliflower florets. I always try to include more veggies in
            our family diet. Gobi Rice is my kids favorite meal. Even though we all like this rice, I make this recipe
            of Gobi fried rice less frequently just because I have to cook 2 separate recipes and combine it in the
            final step. It will be a little long procedure. But I tell you, if you can just spare your time and energy
            in preparing this dish, this would be an awesome dish with distinct taste and will definitely brings you all
            praises. Every one will love this yummy meal!! Ideal for lunch box too.
